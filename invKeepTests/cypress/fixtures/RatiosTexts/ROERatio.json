  "shortDescription": "Return on Equity ratio allows to calculate company financial performance. Basically, the higher, the better - above industry average is considered as good. As it takes debt into account, it is dependant on what is average for company's industry. Usually counted on last financial year. However, it is important to check base period. It may be influenced by inconsistent profits e.g.: if company is unprofitable for several years and suddenly gains profits - ROE Ratio will skyrocket. Represented in %.",
  "extensiveDescription": "ROE Ratio is a better, more comprehensive alternative for ROCE ratio. This ratio varies greatly depending in which industry is counted. Those can vary by even 30% og the value between different branches. Usually, value equal or maybe a slightly above the average of the sector is a proper value. ROE Ratio is a great start for estimation of future growth of stock and dividends. Really high value may be a result of a small equity in reference to a perfomance of the company, which may indicate a high risk. Alos, if profits are inconsistent e.g. company was loosing money for a several years shrinking firm's equity and suddenly it has some bigger earnings one year ROE Ratio would be deceitfully high. The same can happen if company borrow a lot of money to buyback a stock - high EPS without real performance or growth. Those are not only examples of this kinf od situation, so investors must be cautious with ROE Ratio. Negative and positive values of this ratio cannot be compared, as the causes of value are completely different.",

  "example": "Let's assume that The Company 1 has a Net Income equalto 5 000 000$ and average equity of 50 000 000$ in that case ROE Ratio value would be 10%. If that value is good depends on the industry. If average ROE Ratio would be 7%, then this value is pretty decent. If average value is 15% - it would be a poor value.",
