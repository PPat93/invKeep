  "shortDescription": "Dividend Payout Ratio shows comparison of total dividend pay out to net company income. It sums up how much money is being returned to shareholders in dividends. Rest of the income remains in the comapny and can be reinvested, be used to pay the debts etc. 0% is for companies that do not pay dividend and 100% is for companies that pays all income as dividends. This ratio is not a \"game changer\". It adds new value to analysis, can affect it, but definitely should not be decision-defining ratio. Shows how much net earnings are paid as dividends, while Dividend Yields Ratio is a simple rate of return in cash dividends to shareholders.",
  "extensiveDescription": "DPR Ratio is affected by maturity of the company. Younger and smaller companies often pays smaller dividends (if any), and uses the money to develop quickier. On the other hand bigger and more mature companies often pays higher dividens (with reinvesting less of the income). Steady increased ratio across the years indicates healthy and mature business. However, if spikes appear on the chart, it is a sign to take a closer look on the company. Inductries are varying in terms of dividend, so they cannot be cross-compared. Different taxes, industry requirements or natures of businesses makes company comparision reliable only within industries. DPR Ratio is a key factor to determine the sustainability of a firm. This ratio should be rated on the basis of multiple years of dividend payments.",

  "example": "Let's assume that The Company 1 was steadily paying and increasing a dividend throughout the years. DPR Ratio is being higher and higher. That would probably mean the company is quite mature, sustainable and is doing quiet well. However, if in the history some spkies appears or the DPR Ratio is shrinking, it would be a red flag and need a closer look on the company.",
