  "shortDescription": "Graham Number responds to the question - What is the maximum value of the stock that investor should maximally consider. Usually, every value below Graham Number is considered as a good opportunity to buy.",
  "extensiveDescription": "Calculated on the basis of Book value and Earning per Share ratios. It is estimator of the maximum price per share, with which paid the company would be still profitable. It is one of many useful ratios. However, on the opposite to other ratios, it shouldn't be compared across the companies, even within the industry. The only comparison that is allowed is with actual share price. Of course, Graham Number may not be the only determinant of investment decision. Combined with types of ratios can be a great addition to overall analysis.",

That value is the maximum amount that investor should pay for the share of TC1. Every price share below $33.54 would be profitable and every price above that figure is deemed as not worth consideration.",
