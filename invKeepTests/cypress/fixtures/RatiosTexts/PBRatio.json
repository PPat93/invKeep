  "shortDescription": "The Price/Book Ratio allows to see how much it is needed to pay for one share of business in comparison to how much one share is worth. The higher value of this parameter is, the more overvalued a company is. If P/B Ratio is equal to 1, then price of one share is exact the same as it is really worth. However, low ratio may indicate that company performance is poor. Includes all liabilities and assets of the company.",
  "extensiveDescription": "Usually, P/B Ratio is above value of 1, that means the \"real\" value is lower than actual one. That situation is natural one, as majority of the investors tend to overprice assets on the markets. The \"overprice\", above one value, shows how much would you be loosing if company went immediately bankrupt. P/B Ratio can be connected with ROE ratio, which can show reality check about the company. In case of big discrepancies between those, it is a big warning about the company. Growth, too expnsive businesses usually have a cobination of high P/B Ratio and low ROE ratio. Growing ROE should go along with growing P/B Ratio. Even that some general values of \"good\" P/B Ratio exists, it shouldn't be rigid. Industry influences the definition of \"good\" ratio. Good value for one branch, may be poor for another. Also, even the same barnch, but different countries may make huge difference in P/B Ratio value. Growth stocks often have higher P/B Ratio than the value ones.",

  "example": "Let's assume that The Company 1 has $1 billion in assets and $500 million debt. It would be a Book Value of $500 million. Assuming there us about $100 million shares on the matket, and each share costs $10, then P/B Ratio value is (10 / 5) = 2. That means that with each bought share, investor is paying twice the estimated amount that stock should cost.",
