  "shortDescription": "The Price to Earnings ratio is the ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its per-share earnings (EPS). Determines the relative value of a company's shares in an apples-to-apples comparison. Constant negative ratio may indicate a risk of bankruptcy.",
  "extensiveDescription": "P/E Ratio is the most videly used ratio. It can be adjusted to be Trailing or Forward. High value of this ratio says that company is overvalued, OR investors expect high earnings. The most value this ratio has is in a comparison with other businesess in industry or even with indexes. Longer period of times used for P/E Ratio compensates for business cycles fluctuations. Also, this ratio shows how many dollars investor needs to pay expecting one dollar earnings in return. It is important to know, that if a company has no earnings or loses,  P/E Ratio will usually be described as N/A. Negative ratio is rarely calculated, despite it is possible to do. Because of that, it is important to get known, why the ratio is 0 or N/A. Of course, as any other ratio, P/E Ratio should not be the only one that is taken into the account during assesing the stock. Also, the ratio will be different across the industries, as there are different possibilities of money earnings. That's why comparisions works the best inside the industry. P/E Ratio can be influenced by many different factors. E.g. company earnings, leverage, debt, inaccurate information, deliberate manupulation.",

  "example": "Let's assume that single The Company 1 share is worth $150. It's Earnings per Share for the last year are $15. P/E Ratio for TC1 is $150/$15 = 10. This value suggest that TC1 may be a decent choice to invest. Assuming, of course, that it was not manipulated and other ratios are also good. It also mean, that investor would have to wait about 10 years to make back the invested money only through the company's profits.",
