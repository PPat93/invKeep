  "shortDescription": "Cyclically-Adjusted Price-to-Earnings Ratio is variation on P/E Ratio (Shiller P/E). Allows to asses company's capabilities of making profits during the economic cycle. Considers economy fluctuations - recessions/expansions and makes easier to analyze company without them. The lower, the better. However, it does not involve accounting changes.",
  "extensiveDescription": "CAPE Ratio measures real earnings per share value throughout 10 years. It is showing average earnings considering inflation. Thanks to a long period of time taken into account, ratio is resistant to fluctuations of economic cycles. Company profit changes ocurring during recessions and high prosperity are adjusted with averaged inflation. That allow to present if stock price is undervalued or overvalued.",
  "formula": [
    "CAPE Ratio",
    "Stock Price",
    "10 years Inflation Adjusted Earnings"
  ],
  "example": "Let's say, that The Company share price is worth currently 1000$. Throughout the last 10 years Earning per Share was fluctuating from 20$ - 100$ and the inflation was between 10% - 20% depending on year. To adjust inflation, each years EPS should be multiplied by inflation of that year, e.g.: 100$ * (1 - 0.2) = 80$. After that all results are summed up and divided by 10 years - let's assume it is 58.12$. That is the 10 years Inflation Adjusted Earnings value. Last step is to divide Current Share price by the 10 years Inflation Adjusted Earnings value, so 1000$ / 58.12$ = 17.206. Value 17.206 indicates quite OK possibilities for the company on the basis of average returns of 10 - 15 years of American companies.",
