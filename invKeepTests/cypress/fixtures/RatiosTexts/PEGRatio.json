  "shortDescription": "The Price/Earnings-to-Growth ratio allows to compare one stock relative value with it's earnings growth throughout some period of time. This factor is a great addition for P/E Ratio. It is dependent from industry or company type, so should be analyzed in connection with it. It is important to know that EPS growth period is used",
  "extensiveDescription": "Analysis of a PEG Ratio that has a public source means it is needed to know on which basis exactly it was calculated. There is a lot of possibilities to mix different subratios, and the results may be diverse. Ratios can be distinguished by naming: e.g. Trailing PEG Ratio or Forward PEG Ratio.It is believed that historical data using PEG Ratio is less accurate than those used for forward PEG Ratio. The lower ratio, the better. Usually, values below 1 are considered to be undervalued. However, as always, it is depending on the industry. Negative values predicts money loss and company shrinkage.",
  "formula": [
    "PEG Ratio",
    "Price/Earnings per Share",
    "Earnings per Share Growth"
  ],
  "example": "Let's assume we have The Company 1 that has Price to Earning equal to 10 and Earnings Per Share growth equal 9%, so it's PEG Ratio would be 10 / 9 = 1.1. The Company 2 has P/E = 6 and EPS Growth = 7. It means that PEG Ratio is 0.857. Comparison of TC1 and TC2 shows that TC1 is slightly overpriced and TC2 is a little undervalued. However, it depends on the industry, so it is possible that TC1 is actually better choice than TC2.",
