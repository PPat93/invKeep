  "shortDescription": "Price-to-Sales Ratio compares company stock price with revenues. It illustrate how much investors are willing to pay for one dollar of company sales. Ratio below one indicates that company generates more money than it costs. On the other hand, if ratio is greater than 1, it shows that stock is probably overvalued. This factor takes into account only price and revenue. All other data is omitted, what can cause some serious mistakes. It is worth to compare company with other ones from an industry.",
  "extensiveDescription": "P/S Ratio may be calculated on the basis of a single share or on the company's market capitalization. As usually, this ratio can be compared within the industry of a company involved. P/S Ratio is omitting a lot of other factors. The ratio does not show if a company has or will have any earnings. This kind of formula makes it completely dependent from a lot of other ratios during an analysis.",
  "formula": [
    "P/S Ratio",
    "Market Value per Share",
    "Sales per Share"
  ],
  "example": "Let's assume that The Company 1 has sales per share equal to $10 - on the basis of the last year. So, in case of the price of $5 per share, P/S Ratio (Trailing) would be 0.5. It would mean that the company is probably undervalued. To better asses TC1, P/S Ratio for current fiscal year can be calculated and combined with Trailing one so some change would be visible. So let's also assume, that TC1 has current fiscal year sales per share $20. So P/S Ratio (FY) would be 0.25. This values are showing that TC1 is being more undervalued lately. It is important to find the reasons. It may be just the fact that investors are missing the oportunity, and in the near future the price will probably go up. However, this kind of conclusion may be done only with assistance of other ratios.",
