  "shortDescription": "Return On Capital Employed Ratio allows for analysis of company profitability on its capital. It is especially useful for performance comparison of firms in capital-sensitive branch sectors, e.g. telecoms or utilities. Takes into account debt and equity. It shows how many profit is generated per $1. The the higher the value, the better profitability of the company is. Usually investor prefers companies with stable ROCE instead of volatile one. Can be affected by high cash resources. In this app is presented in %.",
  "extensiveDescription": "ROCE Ratio takes into the account both debt and equity, thanks to which performance of companies with a signifcant debt is properly adjusted because of it. This ratio is quite similar to ROIC Ratio, as both are measuring profitability per capital of the business. Importantly, ROCE Ratio is not considering company's tax liabilities, so it is not that vast. It is especially helpful when multiple similar companies are compared on different financial metrics. If the analysisis conducted with ROA, ROIC and ROE ratios, then values are comprehensive and are complementing each other. However, ROE and ROA are better and more complete indicators that can asses a company on their own.",
  "formula": [
    "ROCE Ratio",
    "(Net Income + Interest + Taxes) OR (Revenue - Costs of Goods Sold - Operating Expenses)",
    "Capital Employed"
  ],
  "example": "Let's assume that The Company 1 has: EBIT = $4 000 and Capital employed = $9 000. We also have The Company 2 that has: EBIT = $14 000, and Capital employed = $90 000. In those cases, ROCE Ratio for TC1 is 44% and for TC2 is 15%. So, despite TC2 looks like a bigger and better company, it is only generating 15 cents per capital dollar, while 'smaller' TC1 is creating 44 cents per capital dollar. If only this ratio would be taken into the account, TC1 would be better choice than TC2.",
