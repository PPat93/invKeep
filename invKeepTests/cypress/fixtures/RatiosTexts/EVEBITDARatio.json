  "shortDescription": "EV/EBITDA Ratio is also called Enterprise Multiple. Shows economic value of business. Might look similar to EV/EBIT. However, it also get rid of debt and amortization. Whole enterprise value is compared with company's earnings with debt and amortization before taxes and interests. Varies dependently from industry. Is higher for high-grown and probably overvalued companies and lower for slow-growing, probably undervalued enterprises.",
  "extensiveDescription": "Ignores possible dissortions, because it does not take into account local tax policies. Can significantly vary dependently from the industry. Low EV/EBITDA Ratio can be deceiving and may be a \"value trap\" - some companies with low EV/EBITDA Ratio are deserving such a low value. E.g. if company is struggling, and cannot really recover after crash it would have low EV/EBITDA Ratio and may look as a good investment. However, in that kind of situation it is only illusion of an opportunity. It can be assesed on the basis of future values. If they are overly cheap, it may be a good predictor of a \"value trap\". EV/EBITDA Ratio does not apply to finance, insurance and real estate sectors. For some industries this ratio can be misleading, because it does not reflect the cost of capital investments like property, plants, and equipment.",
  "formula": [
    "EV/EBITDA Ratio",
    "Market capitalization + Total Debt - Cash and cash equivalents",
    "Net Income + Taxes + Interest Expense + Depreciation & Amortization"
  ],
  "example": "Let's assume that on the beginning of January, The Company 1 generated $4 billion throught the last 12 months. The company had $4 million in cash and it's equivalents and $8 billion of total debt. At the end of the next quarter, market cap of TC1 is $32 billion. So, EV/EBITDA Ratio is currently ($32 billion + $8 billion - $4 million)/$4 billion = 9,9. The same time, next year the The Company 1 has the same data, except the generated value - $3 billion instead $4 billion. Then EV/EBITDA Ratio is 13,3. Just one billion change altered EV/EBITDA Ratio by 3,4. This example shows, how debt and equities are taken into account together and how relatively small change influences whole ratio.",
